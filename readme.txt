Picasa LightBox is a WordPress plugin that lets you easily add Picasa images to your WordPress posts and pages.

== Description ==

Use Picasa LightBox to add Picasa images to your posts and pages. You can do this without using any custom tags. Just click the Picasa Photos tab, browse your albums and select the picture you want to insert. Picasa LightBox does not download your Picasa images to your server. Instead it displays them directly from Picasa. Picasa LightBox currently supports only public Picasa albums. Picasa LightBox inserts pure HTML code into your posts or pages so you can easily customize it to fit your needs.

Full support will be handled at the [Picasa LightBox website](http://bogde.ro/computers/picasa-lightbox.htm "http://bogde.ro/computers/picasa-lightbox.htm")

== Installation ==

To do a new installation of the plugin, please follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a LightBox plugin enabled. Picasa LightBox doesn't work without a LightBox plugin. Grab one at http://zeo.unic.net.my/notes/lightbox2-for-wordpress/
2. Download the zipped plugin file to your local machine
3. Unzip the file
4. Upload the 'picasa-lightbox' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
5. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
6. Go to Options -> Picasa LightBox and set it up how you want it

== How To Use It ==

Once you have the plugin installed and activated, go to the Picasa LightBox options page and set your Picasa server (usually http://picasaweb.google.com) and your Picasa user name. Then set your thumbnail size and click Save Options.

Tip: If you want to import pictures from public albums other than your own, you can! Just enter any Picasa user name here and you should be able to pick photos from their public albums.

Create a new post or page. It is recomended to save your post before inserting pictures. This way, Picasa LightBox can get the correct post id and pass it to the LightBox plugin. Just click the Save and Continue Editing button.

Near the Upload tab, just below the Publish button look for the Picasa Photos tab and click on it. You should now see your Picasa public albums. If you can't see them, check your settings on the Options page.

Click on the thumbnail of one of your albums and you should see your pictures. When you click on a picture a new layer appears over it, allowing you to select the size. Once you clikc the desired size, the HTML code is inserted into your post or page.

To go back to your albums click the Back to albums link.

Thanks go out to:

* Michael Toppa for his Shashin plugin: http://www.toppa.com/shashin-wordpress-plugin 
I used his rss-functions-mod.php file.

* Rupert Morris for his Slickr Gallery plugin: http://www.stimuli.ca/slickr
Slickr Gallery is the best WordPress plugin for Flickr and inspired me to create a plugin for Picasa. I like Picasa more than Flickr mostly because I can create as many albums as I need without paying for this. I used some JavaScript code from the Slickr plugin.

That's it. Enjoy!
